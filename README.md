This project is a live, on-demand peer tutoring system. It is designed to allow students to be tutored by qualified individuals in various classes. There are two sites: the tutor dashboard allows tutors to sign up for the platform, and the customer dashboard allows students to get tutored in a particular subject. The data surrounding tutors and customers is stored in a MongoDB NoSQL database. Using Node.js, I implemented an algorithm that pairs students with a qualified tutor who is online and available.
